pdfSpider
=========

Spiders pdfs from a given website :)

It's kinda like a lib that takes an inital entry point for a website 
and 
  1. crawls every found website fitting a given regex-1
  2. writes all the websites to file fitting a given regex-2
  
Since the design is as modular as possible writers/readers/converters can be exchanged,
hence you can crawl anything you like as long as you exchange a few files.
